- ðŸ‘‹ Greetings, my name is Ivan Dominguez and I am a 19-year-old student-athlete from Portugal. Currently, I am pursuing a major in Computer Science at Judson University, as well as, being a part of the soccer team, as a goalkeeper.
- My interests lie in the technological field as it sparked at a young age, and ever since I've consistently sought ways to improve my expertise. Besides that, I have been an athlete my whole life, taking part in different sports clubs.
- A fun fact about life is that I have recently embarked on a journey of a lifetime at the young age of 18. I decided to take my education to the next level and move to the US to pursue the two things I am most passionate about: soccer, and the IT world. This experience not only made me realize how big the world is but also shaped the way I look at it. What's more, it offered opportunities for individual growth, independence, and cultural exposure, as adapting to a new environment fosters resilience, and broadens perspectives.
- At the moment, I am in my sophomore year, taking classes on how to code in C, how to work in GitHub and Linux, Sociology, Calculus II, and History of Civilization I.
- Please reach out to me at ivan.dominguez@student.judsonu.edu.
